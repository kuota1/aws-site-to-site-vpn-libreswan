# aws-site-to-site-vpn-libreswan
This project demonstrates the configuration of a Site-to-Site VPN between an Amazon EC2 instance running Libreswan and an AWS VPN Gateway. The setup includes two tunnels (primary and failover), strong encryption parameters (AES128/SHA1, DH14), and successful routing between on-premise and AWS VPC networks.
